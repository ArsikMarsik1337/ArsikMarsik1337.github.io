    <h2>Recycling Used Oil Filters</h2>
    <p>
      In Russia, the volume of used oil filters for personal and light commercial vehicles (LCV’s) is estimated to be approximately 109 million per year. 
      This equates to approximately 30,000 tons (27,224 metric tons or 27,224,000 kilos) of steel and 9,984 tons (9,885,148 liters) of engine oil per year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only 5-7 percent of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is being recycled, which means that more than 90% of refuse is sent to landfills and unauthorized dumps,
      including the illegal mixing and disposing of used oil filters in with regular garbage which directly impacts the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oil filters contain precious resources that can be recycled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Used filters are a Class III hazardous waste product and a significant threat to the environment when disposed of improperly. 
      They trap contaminants like fuel, oil, and heavy metals that can damage the environment if not properly handled. 
      Even after hot draining, they contain about 10 fl. oz. (295 ml or .295 liters) of oil. 
      Filters cannot just enter general waste streams - careful compliance is essential.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can receive serious fines and penalties if you are improperly disposing of oil filters. 
      Used oil filters are filled with oil, sludge are hazardous waste. That means that special processes for collection and disposal must be undertaken. 
      To sustainably solve these challenges, GFR provides comprehensive disposal solutions that ensure that all filters and oil is recovered and recycled.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our facility, collected filters are compressed into ‘briquettes’ under high pressure, reducing them to up to 20% of their original size and recovering 
      at least 95% of the recyclable oil. Oil extracted through this process is sent to used oil refiners and repurposed, ensuring that your oil is disposed of 
      in the most environmentally beneficial way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The briquettes enter an oven where they are exposed to high temperatures for a pre-determined amount of time during which the paper filter and rubber seal ring 
      are reduced to inert ash which can safely be sent to landfill. The metal is sent for further recycling.

    <h2>Responsible Used Filter Recovery and Recycling Program</h2>
    <p>
      We provide environmentally safe collection containers and a used oil filter pick-up and disposal program designed to keep you in compliance with federal regulations at all times. 
      We offer set pick-up schedules ranging from weekly to monthly based on your site requirements. During used oil filter collections, we will exchange your filled containers 
      with empties and transport them to an approved processing facility.
